This is the README for the use of the different agents. Before you will be able
to use any agent, you need to set-up the StreamingBandit software and initialize
the experiment/default that you would like to use. This can be done via the
supplied front-end (http://localhost:8080/management.html). After an experiment
was created, you should paste in the Experiment ID and the Key in the right
place in the agent files. After this, you should be able to run the agents that
correspond with each other. If some things have to be uncommented, this should
be pointed out in the agent's file. These agents work with the supplied default
code, but when any modification is applied, you might need to change the agent's
code as well.

As a suggestion, first take a look at jss_agent.py. This contains the simplest
of agents and serves as a good start to start testing the software.

Good luck trying out StreamingBandit. The authors are always available for
questions and comments!
